### Dassie as a Telegram Bot

If you wanna implement the bot functionality, you need to:

1. Create a python package 'safe' in the root directory
2. Create a file 'bot_tg.py' with a variable main_bot_token = "YOUR TOKEN HERE"
3. Make 'ffmpeg' command available to run from either the whole os, or the root directory if you need the voice recognition functionality
4. Run bot with 'python3/python bot.py'
5. Enjoy!

P.S. It is better to use... Hmm, maybe later.
